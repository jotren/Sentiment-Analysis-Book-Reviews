He separates the motivation and behavior of these groups very well.Where he fails in this separation is that he then continues to attempt to illustrate his point by using American Pentecostals in his examples. It is clear that he is trying to use the Christian Fundamentalist movement as an example of parallel paths. But he falls in this simply because he, clearly, knows little about Christian Fundamentalism. It may be odd to say, but this lack of knowledge is fine. I read this book to expand my knowledge of Islam and the political divisions within it; not to learn more about Christian Fundamentalism.The author also makes a great attempt to Tie America to a large number of terrorist related activities. This is clearly both part of his thesis, along with showing difference between political and fundamentalist Islam, and his bias.Where he falls in this is that he is quick to use disputed sources. The single New York Times article, that ran nationally for a single day, that he relies on heavily was not followed up in the media at the time because it was so heavily flawed. It was, at the time, seen as having no legitimacy. This single article is one of his key documents.Another failure is his reliance on the disputed CIA bin Laden connection. It is likely that bin Laden is one of the few groups that The US didn't work with in Afghanistan. And then, the US didn't work with him only because he refused to work with the US.In all, he does a good job of separating political and fundamentalist Islam. But, in other areas the book is weak. His thesis leads him in two directions. In one of those directions he is very strong and knowledgeable. In the other direction he is conspicuously weak.</td>\n",

He portrays the current conflict between militant/political Islam and the West as though it is largely America's doing. In his view, since Vietnam, the United States' strategy of waging proxy wars ultimately begot the current wave of Islamic terror against the west. He also holds the west responsible for the plight of the Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein. While the US has been far from being an innocent by-stander in world affairs over the past three decades, Mamdani gives US military and diplomatic influence a bit too much credit--as though the rest of the world were a marionette doll simply going along with the United State's grand design for history. On the flip side, he does not go far enough in holding terrorists and rogue leaders to account, or even appreciate the autonomy of their participation in those conflicts in which the US has taken part. Nor does he acknowledge the nuances and complexities involved in international relations and diplomacy, the importance for any country to protect its interests, and the utter unpredictability of future events.This book is worth reading to get a better idea of how the United States has contributed to the current state of affairs, but it requires a discerning eye.</td>\n",

It will give you a strong base by which to begin your studies. It is a very dry read as most occult books are. You will regualrly return to it for references throughout your studies.   \n",

I love the part where Ash and Beth are walking in the woods. What they both say and do are and is soooooo roamanitic. I always wish that the night world were real!! I wish I could have a vampire soulmate, the idea of becoming a vampire is really cool, i would love to become one. I don't know whats wrong with Beath!! You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books. And hey, if u know any of her fan club addresses, e-mail me. I only just discovered the wonder that is LJ Smith. I only have 4 of her books, but am ordering the rest soon. THANK Y O U ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   \n",

A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.   \n",
       "9586  In all, it is a good book. The only issue is that it could have been better through the inclusion of more examples. And, better use of the examples that it does include. A weakness is that he tries to go in two directions and leaves them both weak.What he does do well is to illustrate the difference between political and fundamentalist Islam. He separates the motivation and behavior of these groups very well.Where he fails in this separation is that he then continues to attempt to illustrate his point by using American Pentecostals in his examples. It is clear that he is trying to use the Christian Fundamentalist movement as an example of parallel paths. But he falls in this simply because he, clearly, knows little about Christian Fundamentalism. It may be odd to say, but this lack of knowledge is fine. I read this book to expand my knowledge of Islam and the political divisions within it; not to learn more about Christian Fundamentalism.The author also makes a great attempt to Tie America to a large number of terrorist related activities. This is clearly both part of his thesis, along with showing difference between political and fundamentalist Islam, and his bias.Where he falls in this is that he is quick to use disputed sources. The single New York Times article, that ran nationally for a single day, that he relies on heavily was not followed up in the media at the time because it was so heavily flawed. It was, at the time, seen as having no legitimacy. This single article is one of his key documents.Another failure is his reliance on the disputed CIA bin Laden connection. It is likely that bin Laden is one of the few groups that The US didn't work with in Afghanistan. And then, the US didn't work with him only because he refused to work with the US.In all, he does a good job of separating political and fundamentalist Islam. But, in other areas the book is weak. His thesis leads him in two directions. In one of those directions he is very strong and knowledgeable. In the other direction he is conspicuously weak.   \n",

No other civilization on earth has waged two world wars with God on each side. To take just one of many examples, consider the Nazi slogan, \"Gott Mit Uns\" (God With Us) used to justify murderous activities from 1933 to 1945.Those who still refuse to accept Christian responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust need to read Rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein's \"After Auschwitz,\" or \"The Cunning of History\" to come to grips with the ways in which religion can be used as a tool of mass death. (Another useful supplement to the book under review is Hannah Arendt's \"Origins of Totalitarianism.\"As Arendt persuasively argued, World War I, World War II, the Holocaust, and Stalinism all sprung from the deepest cultural and historical tendencies of Western Civilization. So, when we talk about terrorism, mass murder, and \"civilizations in conflict\" let's not whitewash our own undeniable history of self-destruction.   \n",

He portrays the current conflict between militant/political Islam and the West as though it is largely America's doing. In his view, since Vietnam, the United States' strategy of waging proxy wars ultimately begot the current wave of Islamic terror against the west. He also holds the west responsible for the plight of the Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein. While the US has been far from being an innocent by-stander in world affairs over the past three decades, Mamdani gives US military and diplomatic influence a bit too much credit--as though the rest of the world were a marionette doll simply going along with the United State's grand design for history. On the flip side, he does not go far enough in holding terrorists and rogue leaders to account, or even appreciate the autonomy of their participation in those conflicts in which the US has taken part. Nor does he acknowledge the nuances and complexities involved in international relations and diplomacy, the importance for any country to protect its interests, and the utter unpredictability of future events.This book is worth reading to get a better idea of how the United States has contributed to the current state of affairs, but it requires a discerning eye.   \n",

I had almost resigned myself to the fact that I'd outgrown science fiction, but this book gave me new hope. I bought Pushing Ice almost reluctantly, expecting another tired version of Sphere or Eon or Ringworld even, where the plot boils down to a group of adventurers ooh-ing and aah-ing as they wander aimlessly through an inconceivably immense and inscrutable alien artifact to no ultimate purpose whatsoever.Was I ever wrong. This book could have come right out of the Golden Age of Science Fiction -- right up there with the Foundation Trilogy. It's a bit hard to get into: it doesn't really get going until about a third of the way through, but it's absolutely worth it. Also, the author made a major artistic error when he gave away a major element of the plot in the Prologue -- my advice to a future reader is to skip it and read it with the Epilogue at the end.In short -- buy this book and rediscover what Science Fiction can be.   \n",

It will give you a strong base by which to begin your studies. It is a very dry read as most occult books are. You will regualrly return to it for references throughout your studies.   \n",

I love the part where Ash and Beth are walking in the woods. What they both say and do are and is soooooo roamanitic. I always wish that the night world were real!! I wish I could have a vampire soulmate, the idea of becoming a vampire is really cool, i would love to become one. I don't know whats wrong with Beath!! You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books.

A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.   \n",
       "9586  In all, it is a good book. The only issue is that it could have been better through the inclusion of more examples. And, better use of the examples that it does include. A weakness is that he tries to go in two directions and leaves them both weak.What he does do well is to illustrate the difference between political and fundamentalist Islam. He separates the motivation and behavior of these groups very well.Where he fails in this separation is that he then continues to attempt to illustrate his point by using American Pentecostals in his examples. It is clear that he is trying to use the Christian Fundamentalist movement as an example of parallel paths. But he falls in this simply because he, clearly, knows little about Christian Fundamentalism. It may be odd to say, but this lack of knowledge is fine. I read this book to expand my knowledge of Islam and the political divisions within it; not to learn more about Christian Fundamentalism.The author also makes a great attempt to Tie America to a large number of terrorist related activities. This is clearly both part of his thesis, along with showing difference between political and fundamentalist Islam, and his bias.Where he falls in this is that he is quick to use disputed sources. The single New York Times article, that ran nationally for a single day, that he relies on heavily was not followed up in the media at the time because it was so heavily flawed. It was, at the time, seen as having no legitimacy. This single article is one of his key documents.Another failure is his reliance on the disputed CIA bin Laden connection. It is likely that bin Laden is one of the few groups that The US didn't work with in Afghanistan. And then, the US didn't work with him only because he refused to work with the US.In all, he does a good job of separating political and fundamentalist Islam. But, in other areas the book is weak. His thesis leads him in two directions. In one of those directions he is very strong and knowledgeable. In the other direction he is conspicuously weak.   \n",

No other civilization on earth has waged two world wars with God on each side. To take just one of many examples, consider the Nazi slogan, \"Gott Mit Uns\" (God With Us) used to justify murderous activities from 1933 to 1945.Those who still refuse to accept Christian responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust need to read Rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein's \"After Auschwitz,\" or \"The Cunning of History\" to come to grips with the ways in which religion can be used as a tool of mass death. (Another useful supplement to the book under review is Hannah Arendt's \"Origins of Totalitarianism.\"As Arendt persuasively argued, World War I, World War II, the Holocaust, and Stalinism all sprung from the deepest cultural and historical tendencies of Western Civilization. So, when we talk about terrorism, mass murder, and \"civilizations in conflict\" let's not whitewash our own undeniable history of self-destruction.   \n",

He portrays the current conflict between militant/political Islam and the West as though it is largely America's doing. In his view, since Vietnam, the United States' strategy of waging proxy wars ultimately begot the current wave of Islamic terror against the west. He also holds the west responsible for the plight of the Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein. While the US has been far from being an innocent by-stander in world affairs over the past three decades, Mamdani gives US military and diplomatic influence a bit too much credit--as though the rest of the world were a marionette doll simply going along with the United State's grand design for history. On the flip side, he does not go far enough in holding terrorists and rogue leaders to account, or even appreciate the autonomy of their participation in those conflicts in which the US has taken part. Nor does he acknowledge the nuances and complexities involved in international relations and diplomacy, the importance for any country to protect its interests, and the utter unpredictability of future events.This book is worth reading to get a better idea of how the United States has contributed to the current state of affairs, but it requires a discerning eye.   \n",

I had almost resigned myself to the fact that I'd outgrown science fiction, but this book gave me new hope. I bought Pushing Ice almost reluctantly, expecting another tired version of Sphere or Eon or Ringworld even, where the plot boils down to a group of adventurers ooh-ing and aah-ing as they wander aimlessly through an inconceivably immense and inscrutable alien artifact to no ultimate purpose whatsoever.Was I ever wrong. This book could have come right out of the Golden Age of Science Fiction -- right up there with the Foundation Trilogy. It's a bit hard to get into: it doesn't really get going until about a third of the way through, but it's absolutely worth it. Also, the author made a major artistic error when he gave away a major element of the plot in the Prologue -- my advice to a future reader is to skip it and read it with the Epilogue at the end.In short -- buy this book and rediscover what Science Fiction can be.   \n",
